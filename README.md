# Hacking-With-Python
I don't just want to use tools; I want to understand how they work. So, I'm writing my own basic tools in Python.

One of the frustrations I've had in the past is not understanding HOW a particular tool works. My inquisitive mind went just let me use a tool; I want to know what's going on in the background. So I've decdied not only to learn Python well (which is difficult enough if you don't have a purpose for learning it), but I'm going to take my love for all things security and learn how the most basic tools used in penertation testing and security are written.
